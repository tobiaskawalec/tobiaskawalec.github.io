I am a DPhil (PhD) student in Economics at the [University of Oxford](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/), supervised by [Michael McMahon](https://mcmahonecon.com/) and [Martin Ellison](https://users.ox.ac.uk/~exet2581/). You can find my CV [here](/files/cv.pdf).

My research interests center around theotretical macroeconomics, with a particular focus on monetary-fiscal policy interactions and the effects of supply chain disruptions. Recently, I have also been affiliated with the World Bank, the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, and Deutsche Bundesbank.

Working Papers

<div class="paper-entry">
  <h3><a href="/files/FTPL_IndexedDebt.pdf" target="_blank">Debt Indexation and the Fiscal Theory of the Price Level</a></h3>
  <div class="abstract">
   <strong>Abstract:</strong> In this paper, we analyze the importance of inflation-indexation of a part of government debt. We first establish that the degree to which uncovered sovereign spending shocks are inflationary is increasing in the share of inflation-indexed debt in the overall government debt portfolio. We leverage this finding to introduce inflation-indexed debt in a model of the Fiscal Theory of the Price Level (FTPL), where we show that: (i) even absent further frictions, inflation-indexed debt makes the price level backward-looking (i.e., it becomes a state variable), (ii) it tightens bounds that pin down 'active fiscal policy', and (iii) in a calibrated HANK model, a one percentage point increase in the share of inflation-indexed debt in overall government debt increases the volatility of the response of inflation to government spending by up to 4% relative to a no-indexed debt baseline case in a world of fiscal dominance.

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).
